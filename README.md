# Research Paper: LLMs in Job Recruitment â€“ Can AI Replace the First Interview?

---

## Overview
This research paper investigates the growing role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the recruitment process, with a specific focus on their ability to conduct first-round job interviews. As AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Gemini become increasingly integrated into hiring pipelines, this paper explores whether they can fully replace human recruiters in evaluating candidates' qualifications, soft skills, and cultural fit.

The paper includes:
- A historical overview of automation in recruitment
- A comprehensive literature review on AI hiring tools, bias, and transparency
- Simulated interview case studies using ChatGPT-4 and Gemini
- Critical analysis of ethical considerations, including algorithmic bias and dehumanization risks
- Recommendations for future use of LLMs in hiring

## Key Points
- LLMs are highly effective at conducting structured, surface-level interviews but lack emotional intelligence and cultural sensitivity.
- AI models risk perpetuating historical hiring biases if not carefully audited.
- The future of ethical recruitment should prioritize human-AI collaboration rather than full automation.
